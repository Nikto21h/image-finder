# Image finder
Refined version of my "anime image finder" now called just image finder. Now only using basic modules!


# Usage
Example command you would run if the image was hosted online

```pyhton
python3 main.py -i <image url>
```

If you want to use a local image all you need to do is to use the command above and add the argument "-a"

```pyhton
python3 main.py -i <image path> -a
```

Thats it.
